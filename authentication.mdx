## API Key Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Partner API Key. Credzu uses a simple, secure key-based authentication that's consistent with systems like Shape, TotalExpert, and Velocify.

### Header Format

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Credzu-Key {YOUR_API_KEY}
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://credzu.com/wp-json/credzu/v1/create-lead \
  -H "Authorization: Credzu-Key pk_live_abc123xyz789" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567"
  }'
```

### Getting Your API Key

Each referral partner receives:
- **Production API key** - For live transactions
- **Sandbox API key** (optional) - For testing

Contact Credzu to obtain your API credentials. Keys can be rotated at any time by Credzu staff.

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure. Never share them in public repositories, client-side code, or unsecured channels.
</Warning>

## Environments

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Production** | `https://credzu.com/wp-json/credzu/v1` | Live data, real credit scans, actual escrow transactions |
| **Sandbox** | `https://sandbox.credzu.com/wp-json/credzu/v1` | Test data, simulated events, mock score updates |

<Info>
Always use the sandbox environment for initial integration testing before going live.
</Info>

## Security Requirements

### Transport Security
- **HTTPS required** - All API requests must use HTTPS
- **TLS 1.2+** - Minimum TLS version supported

### Data Protection
Partners must protect:
- API keys
- Returned lead IDs
- Any score or milestone data received via webhooks

<Note>
No full credit reports are exchanged via API. All sensitive credit data remains inside Credzu's secure environment.
</Note>

## Authentication Errors

If the API key is invalid or missing, requests will fail with an `AUTH_FAILED` error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_FAILED",
    "message": "Invalid API key"
  }
}
```

Common causes:
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Incorrect key format (must use `Credzu-Key` prefix)
- Expired or revoked API key
- Using production key on sandbox or vice versa
