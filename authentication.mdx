## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting your API key

1. Log in to your [Credzu Dashboard](https://credzu.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Generate a new API key

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure. Do not share them in public repositories or client-side code.
</Warning>

### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.credzu.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
