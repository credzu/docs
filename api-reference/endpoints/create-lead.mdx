## What Happens Next

After successfully creating a lead:

1. Credzu sends a `lead_received` webhook to your registered endpoint
2. The borrower receives onboarding communications from Credzu
3. As the borrower progresses, you receive webhook events for each milestone
4. When the borrower becomes mortgage-ready, you receive the `mortgage_ready` event

<Info>
Store the returned `lead_id` - you'll need it to look up lead status or correlate webhook events.
