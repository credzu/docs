## Overview

The Credzu API is organized around REST. Our API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

### Response format

All responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### Error handling

Errors return appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `200`  | Success |
| `400`  | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401`  | Unauthorized - Invalid API key |
| `404`  | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429`  | Rate Limited - Too many requests |
| `500`  | Server Error |

### Rate limits

API requests are limited to **100 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429` response.
