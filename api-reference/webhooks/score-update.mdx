## Overview

The `score_update` event is sent at approximately 45-day intervals with verified credit score improvement data. This is the primary way partners track borrower progress toward mortgage readiness.

## When It's Triggered

- Approximately every 45 days after escrow is funded
- When a new credit pull is completed
- Includes verified score gains across all three bureaus

## Example Timeline

<Info>
Score updates are based on verified credit pulls, not estimates. Credzu's escrow model ensures that credit repair providers are only paid for actual, verified improvements.
