## Overview

Credzu sends webhook callbacks (HTTP POST requests) to your registered endpoint whenever a significant event occurs for a lead. This allows your system to stay synchronized with borrower progress without polling.

## How Webhooks Work

1. When you onboard as a partner, you provide Credzu with your **webhook URL**
2. When events occur for your leads, Credzu sends a POST request to your URL
3. Your server processes the event and returns a `200 OK` response
4. If delivery fails, Credzu retries with exponential backoff

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "event_name",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-22T17:38:12Z",
  "lead_id": 44921,
  "partner_lead_id": "FBHL-55672",
  "details": {}
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | string | The event type (e.g., `contract_signed`, `mortgage_ready`) |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred |
| `lead_id` | integer | Credzu's unique identifier for the lead |
| `partner_lead_id` | string | Your internal ID (if provided when creating the lead) |
| `details` | object | Event-specific data (varies by event type) |

## Available Events

| Event | Description | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `lead_received` | Lead was successfully created | Low |
| `client_account_created` | Borrower completed onboarding | Medium |
| `credit_scan_completed` | Borrower completed credit scan | Medium |
| `client_engaged_in_chat` | Borrower sent messages | Low |
| `contract_signed` | Borrower signed service contract | High |
| `escrow_funded` | Borrower funded escrow account | High |
| `score_update` | Credit score update (every 45 days) | High |
| `mortgage_ready` | Borrower is ready to return | **Critical** |

## Implementing Your Webhook Endpoint

Your endpoint must:
- Accept `POST` requests with `Content-Type: application/json`
- Return `200 OK` to acknowledge receipt
- Process events asynchronously if needed (respond quickly, process later)

### Example Implementation (PHP)

```php
<?php
// webhook.php

// Read raw POST body
$raw = file_get_contents("php://input");
$data = json_decode($raw, true);

// Log for debugging
file_put_contents("credzu-webhook.log", date("c") . " " . $raw . "\n", FILE_APPEND);

// Validate payload
if (!isset($data["event"]) || !isset($data["lead_id"])) {
    http_response_code(400);
    echo json_encode(array("success" => false, "message" => "Invalid payload"));
    exit;
}

// Process event
switch ($data["event"]) {
    case "lead_received":
        // Update CRM to show lead was received
        break;
    case "client_account_created":
        // Borrower is engaged
        break;
    case "credit_scan_completed":
        // Credit data available
        break;
    case "contract_signed":
        // Borrower committed
        break;
    case "escrow_funded":
        // Serious engagement
        break;
    case "score_update":
        // Update dashboard with score improvements
        $gains = $data["details"];
        break;
    case "mortgage_ready":
        // ALERT LOAN OFFICER - highest priority
        break;
}

// Return 200 OK
http_response_code(200);
echo json_encode(array("success" => true));
```

## Retry Logic

If your endpoint fails to respond with `200 OK`:

| Attempt | Delay | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Immediate | First attempt |
| 2 | 5 seconds | Retry |
| 3 | 20 seconds | Retry |
| 4 | 60 seconds | Final retry |

After 3 failed retries:
- The webhook is marked as `failed`
- Credzu support is notified
- You can retrieve missed events using [Get Events](/api-reference/endpoints/get-events)

<Warning>
Ensure your webhook endpoint is reliable and responds quickly. Slow responses or downtime can cause missed events.
</Warning>

## Security Considerations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use HTTPS">
    Your webhook URL must use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate the payload">
    Check that required fields (`event`, `lead_id`) are present before processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the lead belongs to you">
    Cross-reference the `partner_lead_id` with your records.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process asynchronously">
    Return `200 OK` immediately, then process the event in the background.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Webhooks

In the **sandbox environment**, you can:
- Trigger simulated events for your test leads
- Verify your webhook endpoint is receiving and processing events correctly
- Test retry logic by temporarily returning error responses
