## Why This Event Matters

This event represents the completion of the "credit rescue loop":

1. ✅ Loan was initially declined due to credit
2. ✅ Borrower was referred to Credzu
3. ✅ Credit scores improved over time
4. ✅ **Borrower is now ready to close the loan**

<Tip>
Borrowers who receive prompt follow-up after the `mortgage_ready` event have significantly higher close rates. Speed matters.

## Verified Scores

Unlike `score_update` events which show gains, the `mortgage_ready` event includes **actual verified scores**. These scores are based on recent credit pulls and can be used to:

- Determine loan product eligibility (FHA, VA, Conventional)
- Calculate potential interest rates
- Assess overall creditworthiness
