## Overview

The `lead_received` event is sent immediately after a partner successfully creates a lead via the [Create Lead](/api-reference/endpoints/create-lead) endpoint. This confirms that Credzu has received and stored the referral.

## When It's Triggered

- Immediately after a successful `POST /create-lead` request
- Confirms the lead was stored in Credzu's system
