## Welcome to Credzu API

Credzu is a consumer protection platform for the credit repair industry. We operate as a neutral marketplace and escrow-based system where lenders and partners can safely refer declined borrowers, track their progress in real time, and seamlessly receive them back once credit eligibility is restored.

### What is Credzu?

When a loan application is declined due to credit issues, Credzu provides a "credit rescue loop" - borrowers are referred to vetted credit repair providers, their progress is tracked, and they're returned to you once mortgage-ready.

**Key features:**
- **Escrow Protection** - Funds are only released to credit repair providers after verified score improvements
- **Real-Time Tracking** - Monitor borrower progress at every milestone
- **Automated Workflow** - No manual referrals, emails, or copy/paste errors
- **Compliance Built-In** - Adherence to federal and state credit repair laws

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Partner sends declined borrower">
    Use `POST /create-lead` to automatically refer a borrower when their loan is declined due to credit issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Borrower enters Credzu workflow">
    Credzu onboards the borrower, performs credit scans, and connects them with credit repair providers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Partner receives status updates">
    Webhooks notify you at every milestone: account created, contract signed, escrow funded, score updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Borrower becomes mortgage-ready">
    When credit criteria are met, you receive the `mortgage_ready` event and can re-engage the borrower.
  </Step>
